I will be joining the Department of Data Science at City University of Hong Kong as a postdoctoral fellow in September 2025. I hold a PhD from Harbin Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. SUN Jinwei and Prof. ZHANG Shiping, and I am concurrently pursuing a dual-degree PhD at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. ZHANG Xiaoge](https://xiaogezhang.com/).

My research interests revolve around LLM compression, signal processing, and prognostics & health management (PHM). I have published 10+ papers at the flagship journals such as TPAMI, TII, MSSP, TIM, TAI.
