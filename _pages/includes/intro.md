I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Data Science at City University of Hong Kong (Supervisor: [Prof. Feng-Lei Fan](https://fengleifan.github.io/Feng-Lei.Fan.github.io/about.html)). I hold a PhD from Harbin Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. SUN Jinwei and Prof. ZHANG Shiping, and I am concurrently pursuing a dual-degree PhD at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. ZHANG Xiaoge](https://xiaogezhang.com/).

My research interests revolve around signal processing, prognostics & health management (PHM), and model compression. I have published 10+ papers at the flagship journals such as TPAMI, TII, MSSP, TIM, TAI.
